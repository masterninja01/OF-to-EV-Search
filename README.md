###OF-to-EV-Search
===============

The script adds on to another script that obtains the selected folder, project or task from Omnifocus and searches for it in Evernote. However, I needed something bit more. So, if the selected in Omnifocus is a task then the search in Evernote includes a search for the task and the continaing project. 

This will hopefully bring up any notes for the project if the task doesn't have a note created for it already. 

I got the script from [Veritrope](http://veritrope.com/code/search-evernote-for-notes-containing-link-to-selected-omnifocus-item/)
